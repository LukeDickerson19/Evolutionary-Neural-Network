Changes:

Sum it easy/digestably for 30sec viewer
	what i want to get across:
		
		basic concept of a neural network
			use diagram

		what the inputs and outputs of the blob are:
			show visual input in real time

		the rules by which the bots and food reproduce and die

you have 2 monitors
	one playing video of trained bots
	one playing video of untrained bots
	

try to get it all in 1 package
