keys:

ESC: EXIT
r: restart simulation
p: pause simulation
d: toggle super fast evolution mode/ drawing mode
+: speed up
-: slow down
c: toggle the environment being closed or not. By default, its open. 
   (meaning agents are always added at random, periodically). When the environment is closed, it 
   becomes tricky for the bots to survive on their own. But of course, this is staple of a very
   well balanced system. So if you close the environment and everything still lives 5 minutes after,
   you have yourself a very interesting system and creatures!



MOST common key to press is 'd'. It toggles the speed.
